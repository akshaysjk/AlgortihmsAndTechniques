# AlgortihmsAndTechniques
Implemented small projects in algorithms using the Hashing techniques and Tree Data structure.

# Projects Implemented
1. Hashing
2. Sorting techhniques
3. MemoryManagement using Linked List
4. MemoryManagement using Tree Data Structure

Performed time computation analysis of different sorting techniques and analysed their results over varied length of inputs also varying based on competely unsorted ,partially sorted or nearly sorted.

#Implemented in JAVA
